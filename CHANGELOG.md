# Changelog

This is a fork of [Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker](https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker).
Version numbers (`v1.3.65`, etc., see `VERSION`) are owned by upstream,
not this fork — this file tracks this fork's own merged work on top of
whatever upstream version is currently checked out, per the versioning
convention documented in this account's operating docs. Entries are in
Keep a Changelog style, grouped by upstream base version, newest first.

## Unreleased (on top of upstream v1.3.65)

### Security

- Cherry-picked upstream `3ca8c4c` ("fix(backups): preserve env ownership during scheduled
  tasks", upstream v1.3.67) — `.env` is no longer silently rewritten as root-owned when
  a systemd timer triggers Compose project-name resolution. Existing non-root-owned `.env`
  files now have their ownership preserved (`chown --reference`) before the atomic `mv`
  replacement, and when the project name is already correct the function is a no-op
  (no file write at all). Documented as INC-2026-07-27-001.

### Fixed

- Item display names in `playerInventory`, `playerOwnedStorageQuery`, `guildStorageQuery`,
  `searchItemsInContainers`, and `searchItemsInPlayerInventory` now resolve against the
  `adminItemMetadata()` catalog instead of showing raw `template_id`s. Added shared
  `enrichWithDisplayName()` helper. Fixed `ContainerVehicle` name conflict with
  `admin-vehicle.json` preferring `admin-items.json`'s display name.
- Storage and item-find embeds now match Core's actual response payload shape
  (`{grouped, rows, count}`) instead of the never-implemented `{groups, matches}` contract.
  Added `containersAsGroups()` helper for container rows.
- Building types (Sub-Fief Console, Small Storage Container, Fabricator, etc.) now resolve
  to real display names via `adminBuildingMetadata()`/`resolveBuildingDisplayName()` instead
  of raw `building_type` IDs. Catalog individually verified against `dune.gaming.tools`.
- Non-storage placeables (Water Shipper Door, Blood Purifier) no longer appear in container
  listings — added `EXISTS (select 1 from dune.inventories...)` filter to
  `playerOwnedStorageQuery()` and `guildStorageQuery()`.
- Fixed `verify/characters/unlink` routes: repointed from the never-existent
  `player-links-*` routes to Core's real `players/link/verify`, `players/accounts/list`, and
  `players/accounts/unlink`. Removed broken `playerLinks()`/`playerUnlinkV2()`.
- Phase-one 1:1 linking constraint: `linkPlayerProvider()` and `linkAdditionalAccount()`
  reject linking a second character to the same Discord account with a lore-styled error
  message.
- Same-character re-link short-circuit: re-linking an already-linked character is now an
  immediate no-op (`{ok: true, alreadyLinked: true}`) with no whisper, no Steam OAuth
  round-trip, and no rejection at the end of a pointless flow.
- `players-accounts-list` and `players-accounts-unlink` added to `config.js`'s runtime
  `paths`/`methods` object and `UPSTREAM_CONTRACT` — previously added to
  `DEFAULT_PATHS`/`DEFAULT_METHODS` but never to the runtime object (same class of gap as
  the `players-link-verify` bug).
- `formatLinkEmbed` now checks `payload.alreadyLinked` first, showing an "Already Linked"
  message with Core's verbatim lore text instead of the generic "Character Linked" embed.

### Added

- `POST /api/storage/{storageId}/fill-item` endpoint: fills a container (placeable storage
  or container vehicle) with refined resources or components, respecting both item-slot
  and volume limits. Restricted to items classified as `refined_resource` or `component`
  in `admin-items.json`. Sets `volume_override` on inserted items. Added `fillItemToStorage()`
  in `duneDb.js`, `resolveFillableCatalogItem()`/`resolveItemVolume()` in `adminCatalog.js`.
- Extended `GET /api/storage` to include container vehicles (from `dune.vehicles` +
  `dune.actors`) alongside placeable storage buildings. Each row now has a `type` field
  (`"placeable"` or `"vehicle"`).
- Added `group` and `volume` fields to 75 items in `runtime/data/admin-items.json`
  (21 refined resources, 54 components) for use by the fill-item endpoint.

### Fixed

- Adopted upstream's revert of a Compose `name:` pin that this fork had
  added and upstream correctly reverted: hardcoding a project name
  would have silently orphaned existing operators' game/database
  volumes on their next update if their install directory wasn't named
  exactly `dune-awakening-selfhost-docker` (#126, adopting upstream
  `443152d`).
- Adopted upstream's fix for a gitleaks configuration regression this
  fork had introduced: pointing `--config` at `.gitleaks.toml` without
  `[extend] useDefault = true` silently replaced gitleaks' entire
  built-in detection ruleset with just this repo's allowlist, disabling
  real secret detection on that CI scan path. Verified first-hand with
  a synthetic AWS-key-format test before and after the fix (#126,
  adopting upstream `1bbc3b6`, which also adds a permanent regression
  test guarding against this exact class of bug recurring).
- Fixed `tests/security-pr-checks.sh`'s gitleaks changed-file scan
  never loading this repo's own `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist at all (it
  was resolving relative to a throwaway staging directory, not the
  real repo root), causing false-positive blocks on legitimate,
  already-allowlisted content (#108).
- Fixed `console/web`'s container-status-line parsing
  (`isHomeStopComplete`, `hasRestartStopSignal`, `hasRestartStartSignal`,
  `isHomeStartComplete`) silently failing to match `docker ps`-style
  output padded with multiple spaces/tabs between the container name
  and its status (#108).

### Documentation

- Revised `docs/security/audit-2026-07-04.md` following direct,
  detailed technical review from the upstream maintainer. Corrected
  several severity ratings that had conflated verified vulnerabilities
  with privileged architecture, defense-in-depth opportunities, and
  hypothetical post-compromise impact; corrected specific factual
  claims (this codebase does not have a session-fixation
  vulnerability, the Funcom token file is already `0600` not `0644`,
  the self-update helper does not use Docker's `--privileged` flag,
  CSRF-on-GET is not a vulnerability here since no GET route mutates
  state); added exact reviewed commit SHAs and an explicit
  classification (verified / architectural risk / defense-in-depth /
  already remediated) to every finding (#125).
- Corrected `docs/security/generated-command-auth-token.md`, which
  described a generated-token architecture as currently active when
  it was in fact reverted by the upstream maintainer on 2026-07-07 —
  added a prominent status banner stating the actual current state
  and why the generated-token approach was reverted, rather than
  leaving a stale document that could mislead a future contributor
  into reintroducing the same regression (#125).

## v1.3.65 (upstream base, this fork's `main` as of this changelog's creation)

Everything prior to this changelog's creation is upstream `Red-Blink`
history plus this fork's own accumulated feature work (Discord OPS
route wiring, Spice Melange resource-summary rework, Steam-link
character linking on the bot side, the SteamCMD CDN outage incident
report, and others) — not individually itemized here since this file
did not exist yet to capture them as they happened. See `git log` and
the PRs referenced in `docs/security/`, `docs/discord-integration/`,
and `docs/incidents/` for that history.
