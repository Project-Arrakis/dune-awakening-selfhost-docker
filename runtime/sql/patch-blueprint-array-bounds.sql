-- Console imports used ordinary one-based PostgreSQL arrays before v1.4.26
-- and were verified in game. v1.4.26 changed those rows to explicit zero-based
-- bounds without runtime evidence. Restore only Console-owned imports, which
-- are identified by building_blueprints.player_id. Native Funcom blueprints
-- have player_id IS NULL and must retain their native array metadata.
