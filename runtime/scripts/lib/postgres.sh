# One way to reach the stack's database from a shell script.
#
# Every query used to be its own `docker exec dune-postgres psql ...`. That is
# fine for a one-shot CLI command but ruinous for the autoscaler, which runs
# sixteen scan functions plus four log-follower loops against the database
# forever: each exec spawns two conmon processes that linger for the engine's
# exit delay, and each one rewrites the container's ExecIDs array in the
# engine's own state database. On a busy Battlegroup that alone produced tens
# of megabytes per second of writes with no game state behind it.
#
# So this seam prefers a plain TCP connection to the port `start-postgres.sh`
# publishes on loopback, and falls back to `docker exec` where no `psql` client
# exists. The split is not a heuristic dressed up as a policy: `psql` ships in
# exactly the two images that run publisher loops -- the orchestrator image
# (dune-orchestrator, dune-autoscaler, dune-coriolis-coordinator) and the
# console image -- and every container from either runs with host networking,
# so whenever the client is present 127.0.0.1 really is the host's loopback and
# really does reach the published port. On the host itself -- the `dune` CLI,
# start-all.sh -- there is usually no client, and the exec path is the same code
# that has always run there.
#
# The same two transports, the same settings and the same defaults are
# reimplemented once in runtime/scripts/dune_psql.py, for the publishers whose
# queries run in an embedded `python3 - <<PY` block. tests/psql-transport-test.sh
# diffs the two halves so they cannot drift apart.
#
# The engine is addressed as `docker` throughout, which on a Podman host is the
# podman-docker shim; nothing here depends on Docker specifically.

# was ever visible. Neither answer can change while a process runs, so the
# result is cached in the shell that asked -- the autoscaler's scan loops settle
# it once each, while a `$(dune_psql ...)` substitution re-derives it in its own
