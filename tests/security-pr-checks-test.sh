# Behavioural tests for tests/security-pr-checks.sh.
#
# That script is a security gate, and its worst failure mode is silent: reporting success while a scanner
# never ran (it used to print "SKIP: <tool> is not installed" and exit 0 on a runner that had neither).
# These tests lock the fail-closed behaviour so a refactor cannot turn it back into a fail-open "success".
#
# Each case builds a throwaway git repository and runs the script under a restricted PATH, so "scanner
# missing" is real rather than simulated. The first group needs no real scanner (small stubs stand in for
# gitleaks); the last group runs the real gitleaks/trivy end to end and is skipped when they are not installed.
