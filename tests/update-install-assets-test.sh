# system restore needs the images, and must NOT have a database migrated or its
# world partitions wiped and reseeded underneath the restore.

# Every database action in update.sh is delegated to a sibling script, and the
# only inline SQL goes through `docker`. So stubbing the siblings and logging
# docker's argv makes "assets-only never touches the database" a mechanically
